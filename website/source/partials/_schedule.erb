    <p class="description">Whether its a boss, a coworker, a client, or even a close friend, we all know people who've been reluctant to embrace Sass for the life-saving tool that it is! This talk will be a grab bag of impressive little Sass tricks that will help you sell folks on this gem of a language. We'll look at a number of time-saving techniques, have some fun with a couple of crazy Sass demos, and talk briefly about Sass evangelism.</p>

    <p class="description">In 2012 GitHub started using Sass. What started as an experiment in internal apps has become our preferred way to build and style our web applications. In this talk I'll cover how we did it, what we've learned, performance tips, and what we think constitutes good code. We even use Sass when designing for native apps.</p>

    <p class="description">CSS has had a long and sordid past. A developer never sets out with the goal of making a complete and total mess of things. Their intention is not to build something that is practically illegible, impractical to maintain and is limited in scale. But somehow, this is where many inevitably end up.</p>

    <p class="description">Luckily, all is not lost. With some simple strategies, organizational methods and out-of-the box tools, we can really help get that junk-drawer in line.</p>

    <p class="description">Sass can do more than name colors and add a -webkit prefix. With Sass we can create a new layer of front-end tools — written by designers, for designers, and integrated directly with our CSS. We can move beyond simple code demos, and actually share the tools we use.
    <p class="description">Together, we'll look at a range of Sass plugins and talk about the entire process — from contributing patches, to developing our own tools, testing, documenting, sharing, and maintaining plugins over time. It's a great way to improve your code, hone your skills, and become part of the front-end community.</p>

    <p class="description">Frameworks have been built around every imaginable layout problem but frameworks for color remained largely unexplored. With CSS this was largely impossible, but with variables and color functions in Sass we can build entire color schemes based on simple color math. In this talk I will go over how color works, the math behind it, the functions available, and how to fully integrate color systems into your site.</p>

    <p class="description">Converting small visual details from Photoshop to CSS can be a pain. How do you convert the Photoshop Drop Shadow values to the CSS syntax? How do you scale a gradient? What the %^&$ is a Blend Mode? Many of the common layer styles in Photoshop are impossible - or too time-consuming - to faithfully recreate in CSS. However, with Sass we can utilize functions & mixins to reduce the friction between a static comp and an interactive site without missing any of the details.</p>

    <p class="description">Being able to program inside CSS is one of the many benefits of Sass, and variables and mixins give you programmability to some degree; but did you know that Sass and Compass have a bunch of amazing built-in functions you can use to do crazy things like generate colors, manipulate lists, create images, and do complex math? In this talk, I'll wield a wide breadth of these functions to do something crazy with CSS: build a weather app.</p>

We'll take a look at variables beyond the basic colors, strings, and numbers and see how you can put them to work as lists in ways you may not have thought of before. Some things most probably shouldn't ever be used, but hopefully it will inspire you to think about your real-life problems in a new way. As a special treat, we will dive into Sass 3.3's Data Maps feature as well! So come max() it out and join() the party, work those abs(), and stay within scope.

    <p class="description">Our CSS sucks. We've been building sites for over a decade using crappy, ornamentation techniques and shoddy selectors. Our styles unintentional bleed across the site. Our stylesheets are fragile and unmaintainable and full of specificity landminds. Pandas wander alone in the wilderness.</p>
    <p class="description">But there's no need to drown ourselves in beer. New techniques like OOCSS, SMACSS and BEM show us that planning before building can make our projects maintainable, easier to debug, and smaller with reduced CSS file sizes.</p>

    <p class="description">We're going to do it live! There's been a lot of talk over the last few years about designing "in the browser", and with good reason. Why design a picture of a website when we can use the tools we use to make websites to design websites. With Sass, Compass, extensions, web fonts, and web-based design apps a dispersed but very effective set of tools have emerged to make designing in the browser accessible for all of us. But how does that work, exactly? Where do you start? Do we just start with a blank .scss file and start typing? Do I really have to delete Photoshop?</p>
    <p class="description">Well lets turn that talk into action. We'll start with a basic project brief, branding id and materials, and some sample content. Then we'll dive in, using all the tools at our disposal to see how much of a web design we can turn out in the time we have. This will be participatory. This will be an experiment. This may fail spectacularly. Sounds fun, right?</p>
