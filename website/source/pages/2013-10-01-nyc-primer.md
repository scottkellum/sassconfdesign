## Getting Around 

#### Walking
You will walk. A lot. Bring comfortable shoes. It's also a really great way to explore the city, especially downtown Manhattan. 

#### Subway
NYC is known for its public transportation. The subway runs 24/7. You'll be able to get anywhere. Anytime. Late, late night trains run less frequently and there can be weekend train work.
