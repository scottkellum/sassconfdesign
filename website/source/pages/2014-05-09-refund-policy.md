If by chance you purchase your ticket and can no longer make it to Sass Conf, we recommend that you take a minute (or two) to review our return policy.

## Refund terms

If you decide to cancel your conference ticket, Sass Conf can partially refund you up to four weeks prior to October 2, 2014. Once you cancel you will receive a refund of your registration fee minus a $200 cancellation fee.  

Cancellations made less than four weeks before the start of start of Sass Conf, as well as attendees who fail to attend, will still be responsible for the full conference fee. If the event is canceled, SassConf, Inc. will fully refund your registration fee with no penalties or other reductions within 90 days. Any fees incurred by cancellations of related commitments, including but not limited to travel and hotel reservations, cannot be paid by SassConf, Inc. and are your responsibility. If you have any questions prior to the event, please feel free to contact by e-mail at info@sassconf.com.

## Transferring your pass

You may transfer your registration to another person by notifying us in writing to info@sassconf.com. Your request must include your name and e-mail address as well as that of the person who will now be attending in your place. We'll take care of the rest.  Unlike refunds, there is no cutoff date for transfers.
