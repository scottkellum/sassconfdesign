We had an overwhelming number of session submissions. So many that Sam and I decided to extend our plan for a one day, single track conference plan to a two-day conference. 

Hampton Catlin's grito for the front-end revolution will kick us off for a day filled with workshops taught by industry leaders, an UnConference where attendees can propose to teach on a topic of their choice, and an all day SassHack.  

We believe that one of the best advantages to conferences is the ability to connect and meet someone that you may only know through our various online lairs. Putting a true face, a human to the name helps us understand each other better in our work of text, emoticons, and IRC mentions. 

We've purposely organized it so that we, the attendees, shape our own future. We are the leaders of the change we want to see. We look forward to see what the community comes up with. We hope it results in many laughs, commits, merges, knowledge transfer, and new friendships. 

And lots of drinks to celebrate.
