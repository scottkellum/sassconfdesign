We had an overwhelming number of session submissions. So many that Sam and I decided to extend our one day single track conference plan to a two-day conference. The vision for the second day was to open it up to the community and attendees and give everyone a time to work together and talk. 

I believe that one of the best advantages to conferences is the ability to connect and meet someone that you may only know through our various online lairs. Putting a true face, a human to the name helps us understand each other better in our work of text, emoticons, and IRC mentions. 

October 13th will officially mark the worlds biggest SassHack. More importantly, it is a call to arms for front-end. Hampton Catlin's grito for the front-end revolution will kick us off for a day filled with workshops taught by industry leaders, an UnConference where attendees can propose to teach on a topic of their choice, and an all day SassHack. 

We've purposely organized it so that we shape our own future. We are the leaders of the change we want to see. I look forward to see what the community comes up with, but I hope it results in many laughs, commits, merges, knowledge transfer, and exchange. 

And lots of drinks to celebrate.
