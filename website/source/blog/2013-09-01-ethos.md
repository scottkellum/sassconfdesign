**Grow, strengthen, unite.** Bring together the Sass community in one location for the first time. 

**Build better tools for better world.** Sass claims to make CSS fun again. In fact it goes beyond fun! it has fundamentally changed the role of front-end development. We finally have a tool that lets us architect and design our code to let us create complex beautiful structures we call web sites and applications. 

**Support and Educate.** The web changes quickly, tools change quickly. The tech sector is growing quickly. Conference proceeds go to supporting local Meetup groups and promoting educational environments where novices and experts can come to learn and share. 

**Have a good time.** We work hard. We imbibe our work with passion and drive. For some work is not a job, it is a passion, it is their ethos. Let's celebrate our passions, our dreams, our goals. They say laughing xx creativity. 

We don't know what we are doing, but we do it with passion. We do it because we want to. If we didn't who would?
